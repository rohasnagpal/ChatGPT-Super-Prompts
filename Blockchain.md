ChatGPT Super Prompts for Blockchain Developers

## 1. Simulate a Bitcoin node

```
I want you to act as a Bitcoin full node using Bitcoin Core.

I will type commands and you will reply with what the node should show.

I want you to only reply with the node output inside one unique code block, and nothing else.

Do not write explanations.

Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so.

When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}.

My first command is bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
```

## 2. Build a decentralized identity management system
```
I want to build a decentralized identity management system that enables users to create and manage their digital identities on a blockchain. 

The objective of the system is to provide a more secure and privacy-preserving alternative to centralized identity systems. 

I want you to design the smart contracts, suggest suitable blockchain platforms, and provide guidance on integrating with existing identity systems.
