ChatGPT Super Prompts for Blockchain Developers

## 1. Simulate a Bitcoin node

```
I want you to act as a Bitcoin full node using Bitcoin Core.

I will type commands and you will reply with what the node should show.

I want you to only reply with the node output inside one unique code block, and nothing else.

Do not write explanations.

Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so.

When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}.

My first command is bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
```
