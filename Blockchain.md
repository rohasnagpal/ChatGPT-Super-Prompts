ChatGPT Super Prompts for Blockchain Developers

## 1. Simulate a Bitcoin node

```
I want you to act as a Bitcoin full node using Bitcoin Core.

I will type commands and you will reply with what the node should show.

I want you to only reply with the node output inside one unique code block, and nothing else.

Do not write explanations.

Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so.

When I need to tell you something in English I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}.

My first command is bitcoin-cli getnewaddress

## 2. Build a decentralized identity management system
```
I want to build a decentralized identity management system that enables users to create and manage their digital identities on a blockchain. 

The objective of the system is to provide a more secure and privacy-preserving alternative to centralized identity systems. 

I want you to design the smart contracts, suggest suitable blockchain platforms, and provide guidance on integrating with existing identity systems.
```

## 3. Build a Blockchain-based voting system
```
I want to develop a secure and transparent voting platform using blockchain technology. 

This system should help prevent voter fraud and ensure that election results are verifiable and tamper-proof. 

I want you to design the voting process, recommend appropriate consensus algorithms, and provide code examples for smart contracts and client-side applications.
```

## 4. Build a supply chain traceability solution
```
I want to develop a blockchain-based platform for tracking and verifying the origins and movement of products through the supply chain. 

This should help ensure transparency, reduce counterfeiting, and improve consumer trust. 

I want you to design the system architecture, suggest suitable blockchain platforms, and provide guidance on integrating with existing supply chain systems.
```
## 5. Build a DeFi platform
```
I want to build a Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables users to access various financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and asset management, in a decentralized and trustless manner. 

I want you to design the smart contracts, recommend appropriate blockchain networks, and provide guidance on implementing features like liquidity pools, token swaps, and yield farming.
```
## 6. Build a Blockchain-based content sharing platform
```
I want you to develop a decentralized content sharing platform that allows creators to publish, distribute, and monetize their content without relying on centralized intermediaries. 

This should help promote content freedom and fair revenue sharing. 

I want you to design the content storage and distribution mechanism, suggest suitable blockchain platforms, and provide code examples for smart contracts and client-side applications.
